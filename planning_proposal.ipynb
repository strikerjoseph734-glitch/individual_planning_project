    "Based on the two datasets, it is clear that while they are very useful, they do have some limitations. For example, there are many N/A values in both sets, meaning that in order to predict values accurately, methods such as mean imputation will have to be used. Additionally, there may have been some biases in collecting the data, based on the fact that it was targeted at other university students, as shown in the mean and median ages. This means that any results found in this study may be correct for UBC students and their tendencies, but not for the general population that includes a variety of ages. Neverthless, this study should provide important data on whether a person will subscribe to a game-related newsletter based on their demographics. "
